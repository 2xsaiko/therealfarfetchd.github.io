I've had my self-hosted site for a while, but since the computer that was running on had a bad (for this purpose) internet connection, I've decided to check out GitHub Pages. So far I really like it!

This means, the [old site][1] will stay up for a while, but it'll link to this one's main page. The domain will persist, for example for stuff like hosting game servers if any, but it will no longer be hosting the webpage.
