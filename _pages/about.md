Hey! I'm the\_real\_farfetchd. I start a lot of projects (mostly programming related) for fun, most of which I just give up on eventually, but sometimes something actually gets finished.

Some of my released stuff is here on this page, like the Minecraft mods [RetroComputers and Redstone Wires][1].

<sup>ugh, I can't write an about page to save my lifeâ€¦</sup>
